**Title:** Harm-related concept breadth: Variability in understandings of bullying, prejudice, trauma, and mental disorder

 **Supervisors:** Professor Nick Haslam and Professor Brock Bastian

 **Abstract:** Research on ‘concept creep’ argues that harm-related concepts such as bullying, prejudice, mental disorder and trauma have expanded their meanings in recent decades. This thesis examines harm concept breadth, the individual differences counterpart of historical concept creep. Three studies (*N*s = 301, 341 & 302) develop and validate a measure of this new construct, and place it in a nomological network. A further four studies (*N*s = 302, 347, 222, 220) test two models accounting for individual differences in harm concept breadth; a sociodemographic model (Studies 4 and 5) and a differentiated threat sensitivity model (Studies 5, 6a and 6b).
