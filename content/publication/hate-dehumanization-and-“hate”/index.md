abstract: "Hate is a subject that is always topical, but it has recently become
  especially significant. This chapter explores the concept of hate from two
  distinct angles in the hope of clarifying what it is and what it is not. The
  first part examines the academic conceptualization of hate, specifically the
  relationship between hate and dehumanization. These phenomena often appear to
  be tightly entwined, sometimes to the point where dehumanization comes to be
  seen as a part of hate's signature. The second part of the chapter explores
  how hate is conceptualized by laypeople (i.e., nonacademics) and how the one
  concept of \"hate\" is understood in different ways by different people. It
  explores variations in the breadth or inclusiveness of the concept of
  \"hate\": the range of phenomena that people believe exemplify it. The chapter
  shows that members of some social groups hold much more expansive definitions
  of \"hate\" than others. "
