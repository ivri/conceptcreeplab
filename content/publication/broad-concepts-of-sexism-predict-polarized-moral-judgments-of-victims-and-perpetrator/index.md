abstract: Research on concept creep suggests that the expansiveness of people's
  concepts of harm has implications for their moral judgments. The present study
  assessed the breadth of 201 American participants' concepts of sexual
  harassment and gender discrimination, examined predictors of the breadth of
  these concepts, and tested relationships between concept breadth and moral
  judgments of a female victim and male perpetrators in a workplace sexism
  scenario. The breadth of participants' sexism-related concepts was most
  strongly predicted by their endorsement of harm-based morality and was the
  strongest predictor of the perceived moral deservingness of the victim and
  moral responsibility of the perpetrators.
