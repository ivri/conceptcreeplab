abstract: “Concept creep” is the gradual semantic expansion of harm-related
  concepts such as bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, and trauma. This review
  presents a synopsis of relevant theoretical advances and empirical research
  findings on the phenomenon. It addresses three fundamental questions. First,
  it clarifies the characterisation of concept creep by refining its theoretical
  and historical dimensions and presenting studies investigating the change in
  harm-related concepts using computational linguistics. Second, it examines
  factors that have caused concept creep, including cultural shifts in
  sensitivity to harm, societal changes in the prevalence of harm, and
  intentional meaning changes engineered for political ends. Third, the paper
  develops an account of the consequences of concept creep, including social
  conflict, political polarisation, speech restrictions, victim identities, and
  progressive social change. This extended analysis of concept creep helps to
  understand its mixed implications and sets a multi-pronged agenda for future
  research on the topic.
