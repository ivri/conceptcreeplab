abstract: "It is a rare privilege to receive so much searching attention from so
  many admired colleagues, and to have an opportunity to start a conversation
  about my ideas. I am grateful to all of the commentators for their thoughtful
  and generous responses to my essay,which elaborate and draw out some of its
  ideas and criticize others. As a result the work will be improved and enriched
  as it evolves.The commentators are diverse in their areas of interest and
  expertise, representing clinical, social,and developmental psychology, as well
  as sociology.They are also diverse in their appraisal of the work as a whole.
  At the risk of oversimplification I have classified them into four groups: the
  enthusiasts, the underwhelmed, the ambivalent, and the critics. "
