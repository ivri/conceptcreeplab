abstract: The  concept  of  ‘looping  effects’  helps  to  clarify  how  psychiatric  conditions  are  moving  targets.  As  professional  understand-ings
  of mental disorders change, people shape their behaviour,
  experience  and  self-understanding  in  response.  By  this  means,  evolving
  concepts of mental disorder, carried by language, arose
  make  up  new  kinds  of  person.  The  superordinate  concept  of  ‘mental  disorder’  is  also  a  moving  target.  This  article  develops  an
  account of the concept’s semantic alterations, proposing that it has
  progressively expanded horizontally to encompass quali-tatively new forms of
  distress and disability, and also vertically
  to  encompass  quantitatively  less  severe  phenomena.  Changes  in the
  concept of mental disorder in successive editions of the
  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  are  ex-amined  to  show  that  its  meaning  has  not  so  much  looped  as  spread
  in an ever-expanding vortex. Possible looping effects of this conceptual creep
  are discussed.
