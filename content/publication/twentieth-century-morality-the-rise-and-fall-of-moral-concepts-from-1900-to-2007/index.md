abstract: Trends in the cultural salience of morality across the 20th century in
  the Anglophone world, as reflected in changing use of moral language, were
  explored using the Google Books (English language) database. Relative
  frequencies of 304 moral terms, organized into six validated sets
  corresponding to general morality and the five moral domains proposed by moral
  foundations theory, were charted for the years 1900 to 2007. Each moral
  language set displayed unique, often nonlinear historical trajectories. Words
  conveying general morality (e.g., good, bad, moral, evil), and those
  representing Purity-based morality, implicating sanctity and contagion,
  declined steeply in frequency from 1900 to around 1980, when they rebounded
  sharply. Ingroup-based morality, emphasizing group loyalty, rose steadily over
  the 20th century. Harm-based morality, focused on suffering and care, rose
  sharply after 1980. Authority-based morality, which emphasizes respect for
  hierarchy and tradition, rose to a peak around the social convulsions of the
  late 1960s. There were no consistent tendencies for moral language to become
  more individualist or less grounded in concern for social order and cohesion.
  These differing time series suggest that the changing moral landscape of the
  20th century can be divided into five distinct periods and illuminate the
  re-moralization and moral polarization of the last three decades.
