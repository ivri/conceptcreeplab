abstract: "The paper focuses on diachronic evaluation of semantic changes of
  harm-related concepts in psychology. More specifically, we investigate a
  hypothesis that certain concepts such as
  “addiction”,“bullying”,“harassment”,“prejudice”, and “trauma” became broader
  during the last four decades. We evaluate semantic changes using two models:
  an LSA-based model from Sagi et al.(2009) and a diachronic adaptation of
  word2vec from Hamilton et al.(2016), that are trained on a large corpus of
  journal abstracts covering the period of 1980–2019. Several concepts showed
  evidence of broadening.“Addiction” moved from physiological dependency on a
  substance to include psychological dependency on gaming and the Internet.
  Similarly,“harassment” and “trauma” shifted towards more psychological
  meanings. On the other hand,“bullying” has transformed into a more
  victim-related concept and expanded to new areas such as workplaces."
