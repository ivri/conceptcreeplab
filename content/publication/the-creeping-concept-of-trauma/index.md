abstract: 'Over the past century, the concept of trauma has substantially
  broadened its meanings in academic and public discourse. We document four
  directions in which this semantic expansion has occurred at different times:
  from somatic to psychic, extraordinary to ordinary, direct to indirect, and
  individual to collective. We analyze these expansions as instances of" concept
  creep," the progressive inflation of harm-related concepts, and present
  evidence for the rising cultural salience and semantic enlargement of trauma
  in recent decades. Expansive concepts of trauma may have mixed blessings for
  personal and collective identity.'
