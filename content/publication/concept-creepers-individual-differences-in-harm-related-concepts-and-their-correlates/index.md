  Research on ‘concept creep’ argues that harm-related concepts such as abuse,
  bullying, prejudice, and trauma have expanded their meanings in recent
  decades. Theorists have suggested that this semantic expansion may have mixed
  implications. Broadened concepts might problematize harmful behavior that was
  previously tolerated but might also make people over-sensitive and fragile.
  Two studies using American MTurk samples (Ns = 276, 309) examined individual
  differences in the breadth of people's concepts of harm and explored their
  correlates. Study 1 found reliable variations in concept breadth that were
  consistent across four disparate harm-related concepts. As predicted, people
  with broader concepts tended to endorse harm-based morality, liberal political
  attitudes, and high empathic concern. Contrary to prediction, younger people
  did not have broader concepts. Study 2 replicated the association between
  concept breadth and liberalism and extended the empathy finding by showing
  that concept breadth was associated with sensitivity to injustice toward
  others but not the self. In this study, people holding broader concepts were
  younger and tended to feel more vulnerable and entitled. These findings
  indicate that holding broader concepts of harm may have mixed implications.
