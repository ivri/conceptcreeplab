abstract: It is often argued that psychoanalysis has declined in prominence
  since its ascendance in the mid-20th century. To assess this claim we examined
  the trajectory of psychoanalytic concepts from 1900 to 2008 in the massive
  Google Books database. The changing relative frequency of a sample of
  English-language psychoanalytic terms was explored and compared to a sample of
  terms in French. The frequency of the English terms was further explored from
  2008 to 2017 using the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). The
  English terms rose steeply from the 1940s and declined steeply from the early
  1990s. In contrast, the French terms rose steeply from the 1960s and plateaued
  from the 1970s. In addition, psychoanalytic terms were markedly more prominent
  in French since the 1960s. The findings are discussed in the context of
  historical trends in the reception of psychoanalysis in the Anglophone and
  Francophone worlds.
