abstract: "Many of psychology's concepts have undergone semantic shifts in
  recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend. Concepts
  that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have
  expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of
  phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms:
  concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to
  capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena. The concepts of abuse,
  bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice are examined to
  illustrate these historical changes. In each case, the concept's boundary has
  stretched and its meaning has dilated. A variety of explanations for this
  pattern of “concept creep” are considered and its implications are explored. I
  contend that the expansion primarily reflects an ever-increasing sensitivity
  to harm, reflecting a liberal moral agenda. Its implications are ambivalent,
  however. Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated,
  concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and
  encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood. (PsycInfo Database
