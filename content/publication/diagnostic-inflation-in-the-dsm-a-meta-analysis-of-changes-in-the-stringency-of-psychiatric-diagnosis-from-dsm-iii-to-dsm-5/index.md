abstract: 'It is often argued that successive editions of the Diagnostic and
  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) have relaxed diagnostic criteria
  and thereby inflated rates of diagnosis. This claim has yet to be examined
  systematically. We quantitatively reviewed 123 studies in which one sample was
  concurrently diagnosed using two consecutive DSM editions (i.e., DSM-III &
  DSM-III-R, DSM-III-R & DSM-IV, or DSM-IV & DSM-5). Meta-analysis of 476 risk
  ratios enabled 123 comparisons of diagnostic rates for specific disorders.
  Comparisons demonstrating diagnostic inflation (i.e., higher diagnostic rate
  in the later edition) did not exceed those demonstrating deflation. The
  average risk ratio was 1.00, indicating no overall change in diagnostic
  stringency from DSM-III to DSM-5, and there were no reliable tendencies for
  particular DSM revisions to be more inflationary or deflationary than others.
  Specific disorders showing reliable evidence of diagnostic inflation or
  deflation were identified. Notable examples of diagnostic inflation included
  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, eating disorders, and
  substance dependence. Although serious concerns have been raised about
  diagnostic inflation or "concept creep" in the DSM, these concerns may have
  been overstated. '
