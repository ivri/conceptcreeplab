Josh's research focuses on how and when everyday non-moral ideas may come to gain moral significance, and why such moralization might lead to various behavioural and psychological consequences. Josh is particularly interested in the influence of challenges to peoples existing assumptions about the world in bringing about increasingly moralized thinking. Outside of psychology, Josh enjoys listening to podcasts, NBA Basketball, taking photographs, talking politics, and watching movies.
